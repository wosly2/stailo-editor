# about
i made this project to easily type out nice digital samples of a con-script i made a while ago. it isn't super full featured right now (you can't save files yet), but it looks good for screenshots and whatnot.

# how do i use it
on the left, you'll see some text inputs and buttons. to write, you select the consonant and vowel, then press submit to add a character to the screen. there are a limited specific number of consonant and vowel symbols, which i will list here eventually.
